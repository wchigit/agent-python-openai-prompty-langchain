# Langchain+Prompty+ElasticSearch
In this sample, we utilize the new Prompty tool, Langchain, and Elasticsearch to build a large language model (LLM) search agent. This agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologyis is capable of answering user questions based on the provided data by integrating real-time information retrieval with generative responses.
# Langchain+Prompty+ElasticSearch
 This sample uses Azure's new Promptly tool, Langchain, and Elasticsearch to build a large language model (LLM) search agent capable of answering user questions based on the provided data. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the agent's response capabilities.

By the end of deploying this template, you should be able to:

1. Describe the integration and functionality of Azure's Promptly, [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction), and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) within the LLM search agent.
2. Explain how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the search capabilities of the agent.
3. Build, run, evaluate, and deploy the LLM search agent to Azure.
 
 
## Features
 
This project framework provides the following features:
 
* A `agent.py` file that serves as a chat agent. This agent is designed to receive users' questions, generate queries, perform searches within the data index using Elasticsearch, and refine the search outputs for user presentation.
* A `data` folder that stores local data. A new index is created during initialization, enabling efficient search capabilities.
* Built-in evaluations to test your Prompt Flow against a variety of test datasets with telemetry pushed to Azure AI Studio
* You will be able to use this app with Azure AI Studio

## Getting Started
 
### Azure Account 

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

* **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started. See [guide to deploying with the free trial](docs/deploy_lowcost.md).
* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If your access request to Azure OpenAI service doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), you can use [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) instead. Learn [how to switch to an OpenAI instance](docs/deploy_existing.md#openaicom-openai).
* **Azure account permissions**:
  * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](docs/deploy_existing.md#resource-group).
  * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.


Once you have an Azure account you have two options for setting up this project. The easiest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup all the tools for you, but you can also set it up [locally]() if desired.

### Local Environment 

- Install [azd](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
    - Windows: `winget install microsoft.azd`
    - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash`
    - MacOS: `brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd`
- [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    Important: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
    Important: Ensure you can run python --version from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run sudo apt install python-is-python3 to link python to python3.
 - This sample uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` and [OpenAI text to speech models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#text-to-speech-preview) which may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#standard-deployment-model-availability) and select a region during deployment accordingly
    - We recommend using `swedencentral`for Azure OpenAI and `eastus` for the speech to text services 
 - A valid Elastic Search account
### Quickstart
 
1. Clone the repository and intialize the project: 
```
azd init agent-python-openai-prompty-langchain
```
Note that this command will initialize a git repository, so you do not need to clone this repository.

2. Login to your Azure account:
```
azd auth login
```
3. Set following environment variables:
`AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT` and `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`
3. Create a new azd environment:
```
azd env new
```
Enter a name that will be used for the resource group. This will create a new folder in the .azure folder, and set it as the active environment for any calls to azd going forward.

4. Provision and deploy the project to Azure: `azd up`
4. Set up CI/CD with `azd pipeline config`
4. Talk to your agent: 
please take the `validate_deployment.ipynb` as reference.

## Costs
You can estimate the cost of this project's architecture with [Azure's pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)
 
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, GPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Speech: Pay as you go, Standard,	$1 per hour [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/)

## Securtiy Guidelines

We recommend using keyless authentication for this project. Read more about why you should use managed identities on our [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/using-keyless-authentication-with-azure-openai/ba-p/4111521).
